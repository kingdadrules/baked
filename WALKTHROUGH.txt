even if you delete & reuse a world name.

Overall Story
-------------


Each world has what you need to build a portal to the next one. Portals from these worlds all lead back to baked world.

Press "J" (or b?) to manage waypoints.

Portals only from baked world.
Use right click to harvest.


Overworld
=========

Find a village & build it up (1 villager per 10 extra doors) until it generates a "spot the loony" villager.

Enjoy yur conversation. Sell to other villagers to get emeralds. Trade these with the loony to get a Pirate Divining Rod.
He will upgrade his trades to include the Pirate Beacon.
Buy the bacon with emeralds (you can right click rod to turn it into a troll block). Loony will upgrade his trade to include pirate apples.
Eat the apple, it's drugged.
The pirates will kidnap you, hold you to randsom then eventually ditch you on the Baked world, with nothing but the clothes you wear.


Baked
=====

- Collect about 10 baked dirt blocks for shelter
- Collect lichen to eat

5 sieve
8 for compost (can be replaced with mob drops if you kill them).


- Collect 9 string to make mesh.

- Build a basic base.

- Make wooden barrel & fill with dead catcus / mob drops to make a dirt block.

- Make sieve & start sieving baked dirt to get pebbles, make cobblestone for furnace.

- Sieve baked dirt until you have a sapling, plant it on dirt block.

- Use wood and cobble tools to keep you going. Use saplings to compost more dirt.

- Plant another sapling away from other trees.

- Make a crook & use this on all tree leaves to get silkworm. Right click silkworm on leaves to infest the seperate tree.

- When the tree is fully infested, harvest with crook to get string. Replant tree with saplings from standard farm.

- You will need 50+ iron ingots now, you can get them 2 ways:   40

	- Clinker blocks can be smelted to make clinker, 9 clinker = 1 iron ingot (mined between levels 45-60).
	- You can sieve Baked Dirt, make cobblestone,  hammer it into gravel & sieve it for iron ore pieces, craft into iron ore chonks and smelt.  

- Go mining for 1 X lavastone (level 1 to 11) & 3 waterstone (level 20 to 40).

  Old Automation notes for Baked world.

- Make crucible & place over lava for heat source. Clay block from water & dust in stone barrel , breaks down into 4 clay balls.

- Use crucible to melt cobblestone to make lava.

- Feed this lava into a stone barrel & place running water on top to generate obsidian.
  This process is slow until you can upgrade the heat source, so get it in place as soon as you can (you will need 40 obsidian).

- Smelt 5 lava buckets to make 15 flint, use these to make a flint reinforced and an iron reinforced mesh.

- Flint can also be obtained by breaking gravel.

- You need to make a resonator & manual mill to make burnt stone to make water mill to power item transport system & machines. 

- Make flint & steel, go to bedrock & light bedrock for infinity dust.

- Power source is Simple Stirling Generator, crusher is simple sag mill.

- Crush / hammer cobblestone to make gravel, gravel to make sand, sand to make dust.

- Sieve dust, sand, gravel to get everything you need.

- As soon as you can, start automating using:

  - Simple cobblestone generators to produce cobble.
  - SAG mills to crush cobble,gravel,sand & make dust.
  - Auto Sieves to automate sieving.
  - Simple Stirling Generators for power.
  - Coal as fuel from sieving gravel using flint mesh supplemented by charcoal from smelting logs.
  - Item, fluid & energy conduits for piping items, fluids & power distribution.
  
 - After obtaining slime from Arbos you can make & apply enchanted efficiency books to sieves.
 
 - After obtaining sponge from Bathis you can make & apply enchanted fortune books to sieves.

- Fill stone barrel with lava & add glowstone dust to make ender stone to plant ender seeds on.

- Craft dehydrated ender seed with water bucket for ender seeds & plant them (the enderstone must be hoed).

- Next target is 40 X obsidian, 10 X lapis blocks, 29 diamonds & 56 emeralds, 8 iron blocks, 1 redstone block,  to build & activate
  the portal to Arbos. 

  Craft an arbos portal key using 4 emerald blocks and a diamond block then craft this with a portal handle & power supply into an arbos portal activator.
  Make 10 X portal blocks then craft arbos activator with blocks to tune them to Arbos, build portal, use activator to light it & go through.
  
  From each world from now on you will need to kill monsters & collect 80 mob hearts. You can always build mob farms.
